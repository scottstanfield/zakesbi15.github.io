<h1>All Caps</h1>

<h2>by Madvillain</h2>
<hr></hr>
<p>So nasty that it's probably somewhat of a travesty having me
<br></br>
Then he told the people "You can call me Your Majesty!"
<br></br>
Keep your battery charged
<br></br>
You know it won't stick, yo
<br></br>
And it's not his fault you kick slow
<br></br>
Should've let your trick 'ho chick hold your sick glow
<br></br>
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
<br></br>
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
<br></br>
The beat is so butter
<br></br>
Peep the slow cutter
<br></br>
As he uttered the calm flow (Your mother)
<br></br>
Don't talk about my moms, yo
<br></br>
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
<br></br>
And vice versa
<br></br>
Whip up a slice of nice verse pie
<br></br>
Hit it on the first try
<br></br>
Villain: the worst guy
<br></br>
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of *** *****
<br></br>
Shots of the scotch from out of square shot glasses
<br></br>
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
<br></br>
An' show em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
<br></br>
Do it like a robot to headspin to boogaloo
<br></br>
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
<br></br>
It's ugly, like look at you
<br></br>
It's a damn shame
<br></br>
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
<br></br>
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
<br></br>
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
<br></br>
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
<br></br>
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
<br></br>
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
<br></br>
In this pesky inition he gots the best con flowin'
<br></br>
The pot doubles, now they really got troubles
<br></br>
Madman never go *pop!* like snot bubbles</p>
